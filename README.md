Mempool is the fully-featured mempool visualizer, explorer, and API service running at [mempool.space](https://mempool.space/). 

It is an open-source project developed and operated for the benefit of the Bitcoin community, with a focus on the emerging transaction fee market that is evolving Bitcoin into a multi-layer ecosystem.

# Installation Methods

Mempool can be self-hosted on a wide variety of your own hardware, ranging from a simple one-click installation on a Raspberry Pi full-node distro all the way to a robust production instance on a powerful FreeBSD server. 

Most people should use a <a href="#one-click-installation">one-click install method</a>.

Other install methods are meant for developers and others with experience managing servers. If you want support for your own production instance of Mempool, or if you'd like to have your own instance of Mempool run by the mempool.space team on their own global ISP infrastructure—check out <a href="https://mempool.space/enterprise" target="_blank">Mempool Enterprise®</a>.
